# Integrated-energy-grid


## 12.03.25 
We are looking into The Netherlands. 

  Look up the energy mix, to be able to make a good reflection. Find out the prices of the different generation methods.
  We're going to scale it down to some value ( let's say 1MW in total) and just have a representative amount that is the energy mix.

FInd information by friday and we start with the code.
