# The whole code is written in the Jupyter notebook file. In the file called "Project.ipynb" we have all parts, excluding part C, that was done in the file "Project_Part_C". 
In the Data folder, we are storing the data used for the project. From the code files, there is a direct link to the Data folder, as long as they are in the same folder.
